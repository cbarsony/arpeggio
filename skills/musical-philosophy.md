# Musical Philosophy

## The Bach MIDI Revelation

In the 90s, hearing Bach and Mozart through primitive Sound Blaster MIDI — and being *moved* by it — revealed a truth:

> **Great music transcends its sonic wrapper. The composition itself carries the power.**

## Critique of Modern Music

Today's musicians prioritize:
- Polished mix / loudness
- Speed / technical showmanship
- Simple chord progressions (rarely even a 4th degree)

What's missing:
- Musical structure
- Harmonic depth
- Compositional "solutions" — surprising choices that make music memorable

## Core Philosophy

### **Priority #1: Create something unique**

Uniqueness can be:
- A strange 4th degree chord
- An unexpected chord change
- A surprising bass or drum entrance
- Any moment that makes the listener's ear perk up

### **The layer of thought is THE NOTES**

Not the mix. Not the production. Not the sound design.

> "I don't care how it will sound in the final product — I care what the notes *are*."

## The "Connect the Dots" Ability

From years of metal composition and band experience:
- Can mentally hear the final production from raw MIDI + basic synths
- Guitar tone, drum punch, bass weight — all imagined from simple waveforms
- This is the superpower that enables the workflow

## Composing Workflow

1. **Catch ideas** on the MIDI grid
2. **Instrument with basic VST synths** (not final sounds)
3. **Hear the potential** through mental projection
4. Production/mixing = separate phase (out of scope for this tool)

## Critical Scope Implication

**This tool is NOT for:**
- Full composition-to-release workflow
- Users who need polished sound to evaluate ideas
- Production/mixing/mastering

**This tool IS for:**
- Capturing musical ideas at the note level
- Composers who can "hear through" basic sounds
- The creative spark phase, not the polish phase

## The P4 Tuning Revelation

### The Question

On guitar, note patterns felt *almost* graspable — a deeper connection between what you play and what you hear. Power chords (P5), fourths, extended voicings... but something was missing.

### The Breakthrough: Perfect Fourth Tuning

~5-6 years ago: retuned guitar to **all perfect fourths** (eliminating the major 3rd between strings 4-5 in standard tuning).

**Result:**
> "Now every pattern is the same, no matter where I play."

### What Changed

- **Shapes became universal** — transpose anywhere, same fingering
- **Patterns revealed themselves** — scales, chords, intervals all visually consistent
- **Mental model simplified** — the fretboard became a logical grid, not a memorization exercise

### The Mindset This Reveals

- **Seeks underlying structure** over tradition
- **Eliminates irregularity** for clarity
- **Systematic thinker** — applies programmer's pattern-recognition to music
- Willing to abandon convention when it obscures truth

> "I see the patterns." — *Neo would be proud.*

## Rejection of Classical Notation

### Background

- Learned classical sheet notation formally
- Used solmization as a mental workaround (limited to diatonic, but more intuitive)
- First music software: **Fast Tracker 2** — a tracker, grid-based, numeric

### The Core Problem

Classical notation is:
- **Inefficient** — too many symbols for simple concepts
- **Unclear** — context-dependent, exception-heavy
- **Inconsistent** — chord naming rules feel arbitrary

> "Imagine writing a program over such unstable rules — a nightmare."

### The Programmer's Perspective

Comparing notation systems:

| System | Verdict |
|--------|---------|
| Classical staff | Inconsistent, tradition-bound |
| Tracker notation | Grid-based, numeric, clear |
| MIDI piano roll | Visual, consistent, programmable |

MIDI/piano roll felt like "P4 tuning for notation" — regular, logical, no exceptions.

### The Response: Create New Rules

- Designed **personal notation system** from scratch
- Goal: distill only what matters, discard everything else
- Aligns with minimalist dev philosophy: **less code, more clarity**

### Implications for This Product

**Will NOT use:**
- Traditional staff notation (5-line)
- Classical chord symbols (Cmaj7, etc.) as primary language
- Any convention that adds complexity without value

**Will use:**
- Note names on piano keys (C2, D4) — kept for universal reference
- Custom, simplified notation system (to be documented)
- Piano roll / MIDI grid as primary view

**Low priority / future:**
- Classical sheet export option
- Tracker-style view (nostalgic, but viable)
