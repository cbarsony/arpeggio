# Product Intent

## Vision

**A MIDI editor where AI assists composition the way VS Code's AI agent assists coding.**

The interaction model is the key insight: just as AI in VS Code understands code context, suggests completions, and responds to natural language about programming — this editor will do the same for music.

## Problem Statement

*To be defined — pending musical philosophy context*

## Core Analogy

| VS Code + AI | Arpeggio + AI |
|--------------|---------------|
| Understands code structure | Understands musical structure |
| Context-aware suggestions | Musically-aware suggestions |
| Natural language → code | Natural language → MIDI |
| Respects coding conventions | Respects compositional intent |

## Target User

A classically-trained musician who composes metal music using computers, valuing sound and craftsmanship over genre conventions.

*Next: Musical philosophy — the unique mindset that will shape how AI understands and assists.*
